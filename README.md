# flashcard-app-ts-graphql

## Description

Using flashcards can be a very effective self-testing approach. Even the act of making flashcards is a way to “work” the information, challenging you to think about which information to have on one side and the related description on the other.
Flashcards are often part of spaced practice, and repetition helps you figure out what information you can remember easily and what needs additional effort.

In this project, I have developed a simple flashcard API that can allow a user to create, read, modify and sort flashcards in a manner of their choosing. Be aware that in order to perform those tasks, a user need to signup and signin the app.
